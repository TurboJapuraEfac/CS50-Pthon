'''
In Python, there are many built-in data types:
bool, True or False
float, real numbers
int, integers
str, strings

Other types in Python include:
range, sequence of numbers
list, sequence of mutable values, or values we can change
And lists, even though theyâ€™re like arrays in C, can grow and shrink automatically in Python
tuple, collection of ordered values like x- and y-coordinates, or longitude and latitude
dict, dictionaries, collection of key/value pairs, like a hash table
set, collection of unique values, or values without duplicates
